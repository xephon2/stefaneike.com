  - The documentation is missing.
  - The documentation is outdated.
  - The documentation is unstructured.
  - The documentation is inconsistent.
  - The documentation is wrong.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
